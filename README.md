# CSDBuild
Scripts to create NetworkManager profile for connecting to OpenConnect VPNs

You'll need to get the AnyConnect PreDeploy tarball from your organisation. For UCL students/staff that is available here:

This is only tested on 16.10 with 4.3.02039-k9 version so far.

Get the CSDBuild.sh script and run - it downloads the tarball from a URL provided
